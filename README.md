# Dr Diagnosis

We created an optimized system of three classifiers for diagnosing medical conditions based on patient medical history and lifestyle.

## The three classifiers are:
- Naive Bayes
- Multi-Layer Perceptron
- Logistic Regression

Currently, automated medical diagnosis systems fueled by machine learning algorithms are optimized in their ability to diagnose disease. Our intent, however, is to further improve this tactic by producing a collection of automated diagnosing systems where the most accurate and precise system per disease is selected for diagnosis within the entire collection of systems. Any further attempt in benefiting the medical community’s capabilities is an attempt that benefits the general populace. Hence, our project’s reach is vast and holds tremendous potential for updating the current industry standard for diagnosis systems.

We will be using two Kaggle datasets to train our various machine learning models to predict both diabetes and cardiovascular disease. We note the latter dataset includes patient lifestyle choices (smoking, alcohol intake, physical activity, etc.) which provides our models with even more data to learn upon than simply patient medical history.
